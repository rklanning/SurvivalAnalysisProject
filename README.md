# Systolic Blood Pressure and Mortality in Framingham Heart Study Cohort
## Fall 2024
### To test if systolic blood pressure (SPF4) is significantly associated with death, a univariate Cox Proportional Hazards (PH) model was used with death as the censoring variable and survival as the time until the censored event from exam 4. Correlated predictors and gender-specific (e.g. menopause) were removed, and the remaining were selected to include into the model using stepwise variable selection. All covariates passed Proportional Hazard assumptions. 
### This project grew my ability to plan and implement procedures for analysis independently.
